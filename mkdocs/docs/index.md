# Quickstart guide

!!! warning "This page is under construction"


## 1. Power up the gate

Connect a 5V@3A power supply to the USB-C port at the bottom of the Stargate. 

## 2. Connect to the Stargate web interface

Open up the [interface](https://forgemark.github.io/SGA-Client/) on a phone or a computer and connect the gate via Bluetooth. The interface can be used to control the gate, and it provides a way for the gate to play sound effects.

## 3. Power up the DHD

Power up the DHD by pressing the button on the bottom side. **To turn it off later, double tap the button.**

## 4. Dial the gate!

Just use random 7 symbols, for now :) Specific addresses coming in the future firmware together with a bunch of extra features.
